Angel Hack 2018 Hackathon Project

Our project is peer to peer blood supply on demand using Hyperledger fabric. Our project lies under Code 4 Cause category.  The problem that we are targeting with our product solution is the transparent , trusted , adhoc supply of blood sachets between hospital to patient in epidemic or in situations that need some urgent response and action. We r automating this situation by using smart contract that will be deployed on our developed block chain . Thus smart contract will automatically choose the hospital based on parameters like distance , blood reservoir count , consumption rate and many more.This the manual method is overcome by the tech solution that can bring some change in the system for normal user. At end , user will be benefited as he will not be a victim of illegal blood supply and can also know about that blood packet(future scope by scanning each blood sachet and getting info from our block chain . This can remove tampering at-least 30-40% which can be improved overtime ). Our sol will stop the blood mafia gangs and many others by indirectly exposing them if thy steal blood.. Normal user would be able to see the blood requirement and stock currently for any hospital which is in our block chain network  And can take action according to it. Thus end user will be at top benefit.
